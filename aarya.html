  <h1>Aarya Haque</h1>
  <h3>Team Manager</h3>
  <h2> Why is this important to you?</h2> 
  <p>This subject is important to me because as a civilian living ina community it is very important to me to keep my envrionment clean. I personally love gardening and thinks it adds so much more beauty to the environment. Keeping the environement clean needs to be emphasized more, to not do it for everyone else but also for yourself.</p>
  <h2>What's your role?</h2>
  <p>My role in this team is team manager. I keep everything organized and help the team leader with the code and fixing bug along the way.</p>
