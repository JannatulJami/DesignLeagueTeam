  <h3>Our Project</h3>
    <h3>Welcome To Trash Run!</h3>

    <h2>What's Our Project?</h2>
    <p>Our game that we created is titled Trash Run and it is based off of a enduring issue of environment pollution. The point of our game is to advocate for stronger and greener communities, we hope playing our game 
    is able to teach and motivate the player to make a positive impact on their environment. Through playing our game the audience is able to gain an understanding of how crucial it is to keep the envrionment clear, while
    still being entertained and being able to gain a grasp throught their own understanding. In our project the player is portrayed as a cat character in our anime themed game. We picked the theme to be anime because we wanted 
    to create a very aesthetic setting and make the connection of it being polluted. The character first has to input their username (player input) and is then introduced to the objective and purpose of the game. 
    The actual game portion is the player using the keys "r" "l" "u" "d" to move their character in an attempt to dodge the obstacles (slime splatters). If the player is hit by one of the splatters they lose 2 points, 
    however, if they succcessfully doge all the splatters they win the game and the environment is clear. At the end using the objective of the game which is to celebrate theplayer is the congratulated.</p>

    <h2>The Design Process</h2>
    <li>
      1. We first accumulated different options for the categories of mechanics, theme and objective. We then combined the categories to create a game out of it and get the backstory straight.
      2. Then we made a paper wireframe to get a basic idea layed out of the visual representations of the game. 
      3. Then we made a style guide and mood board using figma to follow a common mood and aesthetic for the game.
      4. Then using figma we created the actual mockup which is in detail of what we want the game to look like.
